== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= &#9997; Is it mandatory to download the free version of SCD? =

&#10004; Yes, it is mandatory to download the free version of SCD. In addition to the variant of our product that you purchased, you also need to download the free version. For example, a marketplace administrator who purchases scd for wc vendors must also download the free version of the product so that everything works. This also applies to other variants of our plugin Even the 14 day trial version works with the free version installed at the same time

= &#9997; What does the 14-day trial version of SCD offer? =

&#10004; it offers you the marketplace pro variant for 14 days so that you can enjoy all the features of our product. It is compatible with the 5 marketplace plugins at the same time, so even if your sales site is only compatible with one of the 5 plugins, you will use it very well.

= &#9997; How do I know if the conversion to a local currency is working correctly? =

&#10004; if you only have the SCD free variant  installed in your store, then be aware that this only offers conversion into 3 currencies  (Euro/EUR, Australia Dollar/AUD, India Rupee/INR), additionally to the default currency. This means that if you call your store from China the prices of the products will not be in **Yuan** but rather in the base currency used to create the products. Reason why for a better appreciation of SCD, subscribe for free to the [SCD Premium variant for 14 days](https://gajelabs.com/14-day-free-trial/). After this you can use our [SIMULATOR](http://simulate.fcf-gajelabs.com/) site where you can check how your website behaves once called from whatever country. Or you can activate the end user SCD widget to simulate currency conversion.

= &#9997; can we have discounts on SCD products? =

&#10004; It is possible to have a reduction on the purchase of our plugin. Indeed, if you buy the plugin two days after the start of the 14-day trial period, you will have a 15% reduction on the total price of the product.

= &#9997; How do I contact the support team? =

&#10004; You can contact our support team by writing to us at support@gajelabs.com 

= &#9997;How Can I Earn Money With Smart Currency Convertor (SCD)? 

&#10004;-First scenario : You can manually setup the exchange rate from one specific currency to another, and you can set up an additional percentage to tack on top of the conversion rate (add an extra 10% for example).

&#10004;-second scenario : „Second scenario: set up manually the products price for a specific currency. E.g. the product costs 20USD, as USD being your default currency, and you additionally, manually set it up for €37“. 

= &#9997;I am the admin of a marketplace.Can I get my commissions in the currency of my choice even if my sellers have received their payment in a currency different from mine? 

&#10004;The marketplace admin can decide the currency in which to receive their commissions, even if the seller displays their products in a different currency. In other words, the marketplace admin can receive their commissions in US dollars even if their sellers receive their sales in uk pounds.
